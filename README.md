# financialForecastingMachineLearning


The project "Financial Forecasting with Machine Learning using Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib" involves using machine learning techniques to predict financial data, such as stock prices and market trends. It utilizes Python libraries like Numpy for numerical computations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The process includes data collection, preprocessing, and visualization, followed by implementing models like ARMA and ARIMA for time series forecasting. These models use historical data to predict future values, helping in financial decision-making.
