Summary: Financial Forecasting with Machine Learning using Python

This tutorial demonstrates how to use machine learning for financial forecasting with Python. The project focuses on predicting stock prices using an LSTM-based neural network. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Import Libraries:
Essential libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are imported along with keras for neural networks.

Load Data:
Financial data is retrieved from the Alpha Vantage API, specifically stock market data for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The data is then transformed into a pandas DataFrame.

Preprocess Data:
The closing prices are extracted and normalized. Data is prepared for the model by creating feature matrices and splitting it into training and validation sets.

Define the Model:
An LSTM-based recurrent neural network is defined with two LSTM layers and one Dense layer.

Train the Model:
The model is trained on the preprocessed data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32, using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

Evaluate the Model:
Model performance is evaluated on the validation set using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the metric.

Visualize Results:
The actual vs. predicted prices are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

Make Predictions:
The model is used to make predictions on new data by processing the last 60 days of closing prices.

The tutorial showcases how machine learning, particularly LSTM networks, can be applied for financial forecasting, offering a foundation for more complex financial predictions. For further reading, the author suggests the book "Algorithmic Trading" by Lyron Foster.
