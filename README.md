# Financial Forecasting with Machine Learning


## Summary: Financial Forecasting with Machine Learning using Python
This tutorial demonstrates how to use machine learning for financial forecasting with Python. The project focuses on predicting stock prices using an LSTM-based neural network. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

## Import Libraries:
Essential libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are imported along with keras for neural networks.

## Load Data:
Financial data is retrieved from the Alpha Vantage API, specifically stock market data for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The data is then transformed into a pandas DataFrame.

## Preprocess Data:
The closing prices are extracted and normalized. Data is prepared for the model by creating feature matrices and splitting it into training and validation sets.

## Define the Model:
An LSTM-based recurrent neural network is defined with two LSTM layers and one Dense layer.

## Train the Model:
The model is trained on the preprocessed data for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32, using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.

## Evaluate the Model:
Model performance is evaluated on the validation set using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the metric.

## Visualize Results:
The actual vs. predicted prices are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## Make Predictions:
The model is used to make predictions on new data by processing the last 60 days of closing prices.

The tutorial showcases how machine learning, particularly LSTM networks, can be applied for financial forecasting, offering a foundation for more complex financial predictions. For further reading, the author suggests the book "Algorithmic Trading" by Lyron Foster.

## Next Steps:
1. API Integration for Automated Data Collection
- Automate Data Retrieval: Schedule regular data updates using a cron job or a task scheduler.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage API request failures or data discrepancies.
- API Key Management: Securely store API keys using environment variables or secret management tools.
2. Data Preprocessing Enhancements
- Additional Features: Include more features like trading volume, technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), or macroeconomic data.
- Data Cleaning: Implement more robust data cleaning procedures to handle missing values or outliers.
- Data Augmentation: Use techniques like sliding windows or data augmentation to increase the training dataset size.
